        "I fractured my shoulder and as it healed, I ended up with a frozen
        shoulder. I tried regular PT plus massage to release the knots that I
        believed were causes part of my problem. Dr. Drew recommended Dr.
        Farouk. Said he has this way of combining PT and manual manipulation
        that she felt I needed. She was right. I have made significant
        improvement in a matter of a few short weeks. I will tell anyone who
        needs PT to see Dr. Farouk."

        "After my shoulder surgery, I could hardly extend my forearm. During
        each visit with Dr. Farouk, I became gradually more mobile. He also gave
        me specific exercises to do when I was at home. After eight weeks of
        visits, my forearm can be fully extended, and I have full range of
        motion in my shoulder. I recommend Dr. Farouk to everyone I know."
